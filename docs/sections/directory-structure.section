\fIgit-chat\fR uses a rather simple directory structure. When a repository is initialized, three directories are created at the root of the working tree: \fB.git\fR, \fB.git-chat\fR, and \fB.keys\fR.

.TP
.B .git
This directory is created by \fIgit-init\fR, and is largely untouched by git-chat, with the exception of \fB.git/chat-cache\fR which contains git-chat configuration files and temporary files. The git-chat gpg keyring is also located under \fB.git/.gnupg\fR.

.TP
.B .git-chat
This directory is created by \fIgit-chat-init\fR. It contains channel metadata, such as the channel name and description. Exported GPG keys are located under \fB.git-chat/keys\fR. These files are tracked, and are therefore public to all users.
